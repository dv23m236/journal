## Weekly Summary

This week I continued working on NUT. I was able to successfully install NUT and get it running. After it worked, I created a snapshot and reset the VM. I then restored the old snapshot and started deploying NUT with Ansible. This was more difficult for me than without Ansible, as you also have to define the configurations in the playbook. Since I don't have much experience with Ansible yet, I tried to implement it in the best possible way using AI, which didn't quite work as I had imagined. At least I managed to install both NUT and Docker via the playbook, but unfortunately nothing more. We left it at that.

## Reflection

This week, the manual installation and launch of NUT went very well. I was able to successfully install and start the service, and restoring the snapshots also worked perfectly. Deploying with Ansible proved to be much more difficult, as you not only have to define the installation, but also the configuration via the playbook. However, this did not work as well as I had hoped. At least I managed to install both NUT and Docker via the playbook, but I didn't get any further than that. Overall, it was a solid week. I realized that automation with Ansible requires more preparation and knowledge than I had initially assumed. At the same time, I learned how important it is to question the use of supporting tools such as AI and not to consider them as the only solution.
