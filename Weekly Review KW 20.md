# Weekly Review KW 20 

## Tasks and Progress

- **Install Server**
- **Documentation SYS**
- **Github Ansible Project**


## Weekly Summary

On Monday morning, Peter and I installed two new servers in the H4 data center. The installation went smoothly and quickly. Afterwards, I focused on my documentation, which I structured and expanded throughout the day. On Tuesday, I worked together with Nico on my ITJournal project. Due to some confusion and structural issues, we decided to start over. After several attempts, along with thorough analysis and testing, we gradually made progress and got closer to building a well structured, usable website. On Wednesday, I continued working on my Ansible project. I was able to automate additional tasks and test various playbooks. The project is developing in the right direction. In the afternoon, I documented my progress as thoroughly as possible and added screenshots to clearly show the current state.

## Reflection

This week, I was able to make solid progress in several areas. The server installation on Monday went smoothly and efficiently, thanks to good preparation and teamwork with Peter. Despite initial structural issues, the collaboration with Nico on the ITJournal project also proved successful after several retries and in depth analysis, we developed a working and well organized solution. My Ansible project is also moving forward positively. I automated more tasks, tested playbooks, and documented the results. Overall, it was a productive week. However, the ITJournal project highlighted how much time can be saved with more thorough planning from the start. Restarting the project multiple times was a valuable learning experience but also time consuming. For future projects, I plan to define a clearer structure and objectives early on to work more efficiently. Maintaining ongoing documentation is also helpful,not only does it support implementation, but it also improves traceability and reflection on oneâ€™s work.
