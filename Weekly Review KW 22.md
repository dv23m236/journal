## Weekly Summary

On Monday morning, I reviewed the ESXi task assigned by Simon, but finally did not proceed with it. Instead, I completed the Ansible project from Mathis. On Tuesday, I worked with Peter to take a closer look at the UNI backup system and received some initial tasks. However, I wasn’t able to work very independently, as I lacked the necessary access rights in many areas. On Wednesday, I continued working on the backup tasks, created and deleted various backups, and carefully documented all steps.

- No access to certain websites and services

- **Assistance needed for the problems:**

- **Together with Peter:** We did it together on his device
 


## Reflection

I successfully completed Mathis’s Ansible project and was able to engage more deeply with the backup system. A highlight was being able to create, delete, and document backups independently on Wednesday. While I had already studied the topic in vocational school, this time I was working with a different service, which made the experience valuable. The lack of access rights significantly limited my ability to work independently. We’re not exactly sure why this was the case. I learned how important full access rights are for efficient work. In addition, I was able to slightly expand my knowledge of backup systems.
