On Monday and Tuesday, I focused on technical tasks. I completed the guides and finalized my documentation for the WPS MAC group.  
On Wednesday, I took the Apple Support Practice Exam, which had a time limit of two hours, but I only needed one hour. The exam went well, and I passed with 86 out of 100 points.  
After the exam, I informed Tobias about the results and then studied for school, as I had a math exam on Thursday and a Module 143 exam on Friday.  
I forwarded the completed guides and documentation to Tobias and Birgit for review and feedback.
