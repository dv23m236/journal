## Weekly Summary

This week was all about preparing for the trial day. Anointan and I spent Monday and Tuesday making all the necessary preparations and ensuring that everything would run smoothly. On Monday, we went through the presentations together, and on Tuesday, we set up the workstations for the trial participants. The room was a bit small, but since one person canceled at the last minute, the space turned out to be just enough. The trial day itself went quite well overall. The participants seemed more or less interested, and from my point of view, it was a successful day. I believe we were able to give them a positive impression of the company and our daily work.

## Reflection

The preparation for the trial day was structured and efficient. Anointan and I worked well together, and despite a few small challenges, everything went smoothly on the day itself. The technology worked as expected, and the schedule was well organized. The room was a bit cramped, so in the future, we could look into reserving a larger space earlier on. We might also consider ways to involve the participants more actively to spark greater interest. Good planning is key to a smooth process, and I’ve also realized how important clear communication within the team is. It’s also worth staying flexible and being able to adapt to last-minute changes—like the participant who canceled.
