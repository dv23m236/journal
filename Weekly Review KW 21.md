## Tasks and Progress

- ESXi Tasks
- Documentation
- Ansible
- Github


## Weekly Summary

On Monday morning, I continued working on my documentation. Afterwards, I received some tasks related to ESXi from Simon. The tasks themselves weren't too difficult, nevertheless I enjoyed solving them. It was exciting to revisit topics like virtual servers and to apply my knowledge in that area again.

On Tuesday, I continued working on my GitHub project and tried to make the website look more visually appealing. Unfortunately, I’m not completely satisfied with the result yet, some changes didn’t work as intended or didn’t look very good. I’ll keep working on it and try different ways to achieve a better design.

On Wednesday, I focused on Mathis Ansible project. I was able to make some progress, and overall the project seems solid. However, the structure isn’t entirely clear yet, and the automations don’t work as expected so far.

## Reflection

I was able to actively contribute in several areas and gain valuable hands on experience, especially with ESXi and Ansible. Even though not everything worked right away, it was motivating to be involved in different projects. For the GitHub website project, a clearer plan for the design would be helpful. For the Ansible project, better documentation of the existing structure would make it easier to get an overview.

I realized how important it is to approach design tasks in a structured way and to regularly review the progress. I was also reminded of how useful good documentation is in technical projects for one’s own orientation as well as for collaboration within a team.
