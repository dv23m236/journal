## Weekly Summary

This week was a bit shorter than usual because Monday was a public holiday (Easter Monday).  
On Tuesday, I was tasked with creating a website on GitHub to store and document my work. I didn’t find much information online, as I wasn’t exactly sure which files were needed, so I didn’t make much progress.  
On Wednesday morning, I continued working on it. Around 10:00 AM, I had my first semester report meeting with Cord, which went well.  
In the afternoon, my learning journal review took place, which was short because I had been on vacation the previous week. Afterwards, my weekly meeting followed, which was also short.  
After the weekly, I looked into Ansible together with Mathis.

- **Problems encountered:**
  - Creating a GitHub website

- **Assistance needed for the problems:**
  - **Nico:** We will review it together next week

## Reflection

The semester report meeting with Cord went successfully, and the short reviews (learning journal and weekly) showed that I managed to stay on top of things despite having been on vacation.  
Additionally, I was able to gain new knowledge about Ansible while working with Mathis.  
When creating the GitHub website, I could have taken a more structured approach. It would have been helpful to first thoroughly research which basic files and structures were necessary.
