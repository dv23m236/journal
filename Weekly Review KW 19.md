# Weekly Review KW 19

## Tasks and Progress

- GPU Stack Server moved
- Practical with Ansible
- SSD & HDD removed/Installed
- GPU STack Server set up
- Ticket 


## Weekly Summary

On Monday morning, I went to the PH building together with Matze. There, we removed and installed SSDs and HDDs. Afterwards, we moved the server to another room, where it will be used as a test server in the future. I was supposed to prepare a USB stick with Rocky Linux in advance, but I forgot to properly write the ISO image using balenaEtcher. Instead, I had only copied the ISO file directly onto the stick. When we plugged the USB stick into the server and it didn't boot, I realized my mistake. Once the server was set up, we went back and completed the installation remotely.
On Tuesday, I worked on a ticket I had received from Chrigu. I was able to solve the problem successfully on the GPU stack and gave Chrigu positive feedback. On Wednesday, I continued working with Ansible together with Mathis. I started my own Ansible project on a VM that Mathis provided me.


## Problems and Assistance

- **Problems encountered:**

- The GPU Stack Server didn't boot of the USB

- **Assistance needed for the problems:**

- **Matze and I**: Installed the iso file remotely on the GPU stack


## Reflection

I successfully installed SSDs and HDDs with Matze and helped move the server. Even though there was an issue with the USB stick at first, we were able to set up the system remotely later. I was also able to resolve the ticket from Chrigu, which made me happy. In addition, I began working with Ansible and started my own project. I should have properly prepared the USB stick. The mistake with the ISO file cost us time and could have been avoided. In the future, I need to check more carefully that everything is set up correctly. Good preparation is important, especially for installations. Even when mistakes happen, you can always learn from them. I realized how helpful tools like Ansible can be if you work with them step by step.
