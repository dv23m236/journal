## Weekly Summary

In my first official week at SYS, I learned many new things that I hadnâ€™t worked with before. On Monday morning, I connected to the stage server via SSH together with Matze. Right afterward, I installed several essential tools including:

- tmux
- Homebrew
- vim

Later that day, Matze shared a tmux configuration file (tmux.conf) with me, which I applied to my system. That way, I had the same setup as him, which made working together much easier.

On Tuesday morning, I was assigned to create two virtual machines (VMs) using a Vagrantfile that was already placed on the stage server. After successfully spinning up the VMs, I connected to both via SSH and verified:

- That they could ping each other
- That an SSH connection between the VMs was possible

Matze also gave me a few helpful commands that made the task easier to manage.

On Wednesday, I was tasked with independently setting up a web server. Writing the Vagrantfile for it turned out to be a bit challenging, and initially, it didnâ€™t work as expected. After reviewing it with Matze, he sent me his working configuration and we looked through it together.

Once the web server was up and running, I had the chance to create my own website. With a bit of help from online resources, I built a One Piece themed website, which actually turned out quite well.

On Wednesday afternoon and Thursday, I focused on GitHub. I explored different websites and completed the assignments listed in the training plan for week two. During this time, I also created my own repository, where Iâ€™ll be documenting all future tasks and projects.

## Challenges and Support

### Issues I Encountered

- I didnâ€™t have access to the Vagrantfile due to missing permissions.
- A required plugin was not installed, which prevented the Vagrantfile from executing properly.

### Help I Received

- **Matze**: adjusted the file permissions for me, as I couldnâ€™t change them myself.
- **Nico**: and I first turned the problematic line into a comment, and later installed the missing plugin to solve the issue.

## Reflection

This first week at SYS was both exciting and challenging a strong start to hands-on learning. What I appreciated most was being able to actively participate in real tasks instead of just watching.

I got to work with several important tools commonly used in the industry, such as SSH, tmux, Vagrant, and GitHub. Even though not everything worked perfectly at first, I learned a lot through trial and error, reading documentation, and asking questions. Collaborating with Matze and Nico also showed me how valuable it is to communicate and work through problems together.

The GitHub part helped me better understand the importance of **version control** and **clean documentation**, which will be essential going forward.

Overall, Iâ€™m very happy with how this first week went, and Iâ€™m looking forward to learning more in the upcoming weeks.
